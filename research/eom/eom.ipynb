    "# End-of-Month Rebalancing: SPY vs. TLT\n",
    "End-of-month rebalancing is a recurring flow-driven pattern where institutional investors adjust portfolio weights near month-end to keep allocations aligned with mandates (e.g., 60/40 targets), risk limits, and reporting constraints. When one leg (equities or bonds) strongly outpefroms earlier in the month, portfolios drift away from target weights. As month-end approaches, managers rebalance - selling the relative winner and buying the relative loser - creating a tendency toward late-month mean reversion in relative performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elevator pitch\n",
    "### What would cause the inefficiency?\n",
    "The inefficiency is caused by large, price-insensitive rebalancing flows near month-end. If SPY outperforms TLT early in the month, balanced portfolios become equity-heavy and may mechanically sell equities and buy bonds to restore target weights. If TLT outperforms SPY early, the opposite rebalancing occurs. Because these trades are driven by portfolio constraints and institutional process (rather than new information about fundamentals), they can create a systematic relationship between early-month relative performance and late-month relative performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it wouldn’t be fully gobbled up by others who are quicker or better informed?\n",
    "Even if the effect is known, it’s hard to fully arbitrage because the edge is typically small, timing-sensitive, and varies across market regimes. The flows can be lumpy, crowding can reduce returns, and the strategy is exposed to event risk (macro surprises, CPI/FOMC, shocks) that can swamp a mild seasonal tendency. Additionally, the rebalancing pressure is driven by the largest allocators (pensions, balanced funds), and opposing it requires balance-sheet capacity at precisely the time when liquidity and risk limits can tighten into month-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How might a retail investor harness it, on average?\n",
    "A retail investor can harness it with a simple, rules-based relative-positioning approach: condition on early-month relative performance (SPY vs TLT) and take a modest late-month position aligned with the expected rebalancing direction. The practical version is conditional, not unconditional: the reversal tendency should be tested primarily when early-month relative performance is meaningfully positive or negative (i.e., strong drift away from target weights), and often shows weaker behavior when early-month moves are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "The scenarios we should check. First define relative return:\n",
    "* $R_{early}^{rel} = R_{SPY,1-15} - R_{TLT,1-15}$\n",
    "* $R_{late}^{rel} = R_{SPY,16-EOM} - R_{TLT,16-EOM}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then classify early state into 3 bins:\n",
    "1. Early ~ neutral: $|R_{early}^{rel}| < \\tau$\n",
    "2. Early equities lead: $|R_{early}^{rel}| > \\tau$\n",
    "3. Early bonds lead: $|R_{early}^{rel}| < \\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then within each, late outcome can be:\n",
    "* **Reversal**: sign flips (or late < 0 when early > 0, etc.)\n",
    "* **Continuation**: same sign\n",
    "* **No move**: late close to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the steps we’ll follow to test whether early-month relative performance predicts late-month reversal or continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load daily returns for SPY and TLT\n",
    "2. Create trading-month structure: Day of the month (DOTM) and month identifiers; define two windows:\n",
    "    * Early window: trading days 1-15\n",
    "    * Late windoow: trading days 16-EOM\n",
    "3. Compute early and late **relative returns** per month:\n",
    "    * $R_{early}^{rel}$ and $R_{late}^{rel}$\n",
    "4. Visualize state -> outcome:\n",
    "    * Scatter plot $R_{early}^{rel}$ vs $R_{late}^{rel}$ with regression line\n",
    "    * Split by early outperformance sign (SPY-leading vs TLT-leading) and compare slopes\n",
    "5. Define scenarios using threshold $\\tau$ (e.g., $0.5\\sigma$ or $1\\sigma$ of $R_{early}^{rel}$):\n",
    "    * Early neutral: $|R_{early}^{rel}| < \\tau$\n",
    "    * Early SPY-leading: $|R_{early}^{rel}| > \\tau$\n",
    "    * Early TLT-leading: $|R_{early}^{rel}| < \\tau$\n",
    "6. For each scenario, compute:\n",
    "    * Probability of reversal vs. continuation\n",
    "    * Average and median $R_{late}^{rel}$\n",
    "    * Distribution plots (hist/box) and simple significance tests/bootstrap CIs\n",
    "7. Robustness checks:\n",
    "    * Different splits (1-10 vs 11-EOM, 1-12 vs 13-EOM, last 5 trading days only)\n",
    "    * Subsample stability (pre/post 2008, pre/post 2020, rate-regime splits)\n",
    "    * Eexcluding major event days (FOMC/CPI weeks) to see if effect survives\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtest\n",
    "Design the backtest as a conditional relative-value rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each month, compute $R_{early}^{rel} after day 15 close$\n",
    "2. If $R_{early}^{rel} > \\tau$: take the \"rebalance\" side for late month (expect SPY to cool vs TLT)\n",
    "3. If $R_{early}^{rel} < -\\tau$: take the opposite side (expect TLT to cool vs SPY)\n",
    "4. If $|R_{early}^{rel}| <= \\tau$: no trade (or small trade) to avoid noise regime\n",
    "5. Measure performance on $R_{late}^{rel}$, and report:\n",
    "    * Total/annualized return, vol, Sharpe\n",
    "    * Max drawdown\n",
    "    * Hit rate (months profitable)\n",
    "    * Performance by regime (rate up vs rate down, equity vol regimes)"
